define Package/seattle/description
        Seattle is a platform for networking and distributed systems research.
        Seattle runs on end-user systems in a safe and contained manner, with 
        support for several platforms. Users install and run Seattle with minimal 
        impact on system security and performance. Sandboxes are established on the 
        user's computer to limit the consumption of resources such as CPU, memory, storage 
        space, and network bandwidth.
