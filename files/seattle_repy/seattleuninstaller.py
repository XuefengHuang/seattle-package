<Program Name>
  seattleuninstaller.py
<Started>
  November 8, 2009
<Author>
  Zachary Boka, with some code inspired by Carter Butaud
<Purpose>
  Kills any seattle processes that are running, and removes seattle from any
  startup scripts, locations, keys, or programs.
  Linux/Mac/FreeBSD: remove seattle entry from the crontab.
  Windows: remove seattle from the registry (and the Startup folder if installed
           there).
  NOTE: Unlike seattleinstaller.py, this uninstaller was not created to
        potentially handle WindowsCE.  This uninstaller has no functionality for
        WindowsCE!
