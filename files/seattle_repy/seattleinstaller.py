<Purpose>
  Installs seattle on any supported system. This means setting up the computer
  to run seattle at startup, generating node keys, customizing configuration
  files, and starting seattle running (not necessarily in that order, except
  that seattle must always be started running last).

    this method attempts to add a link to the Windows startup folder which will
    only run seattle when this user logs in.

  <Arguments>

  <Exceptions>

  <Side Effects>
    Adds a value named "seattle", which contains the absolute file path to the
    seattle starter script, to the startup registry key, or adds seattle to the
